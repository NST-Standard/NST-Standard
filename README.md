# Non-Sellable Tokens (NST)

> NST is an extension of [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) to create non-sellable tokens. It aims to prevent a financial sale by introducing a barter mechanism which replace one-way transfers by two-way transfers. Users are forced to barter tokens, send to receive or receive to send. Bartering possibilities between tokens are defined by tokens creators, who must therefore maintain an equivalence of value to make unattractive the sale of a token.

> The barter mechanism of this EIP can be interpreted as a *multi-signature* transfer where a signed message is created by a token holder to define which tokens will be bartered and then executed, if accepted, by the owner of wanted tokens on the smart contract to perform the barter.
